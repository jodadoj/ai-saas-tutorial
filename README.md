# Creating a SaaS AI app #

The source of this project again comes from another [Code with Antonio's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffJ38dBzrlY) guide. As with my Spotify clone, this written step-by-step is intended to complement the guide by clearing showing the state of the codebase at different steps and act as a revision tool for smaller details that are easier scanned in print.

### [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Getting Started 

Follow the same setup as the Spotify clone. This project will also then use the UI-library `shadcn` which is documented [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> **Note**
>
>  The original guide uses `npx` solely whereas we will be using `yarn` when posssible. The `shadcn` CSS framework is only up-to-date via `npx` and so we follow the instructions given via their docs exactly.
